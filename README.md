# Manjaro Linux Gaming Scripts

Hello World !

Here is a little repository for helping people initialize their new installation of Manjaro Linux for making it ready for gaming.

- Playbooks : this is some playbooks for Ansible (use it with ansible-playbook command) that will automaticaly install some group of softwares for gaming, or tweaks for optimize your computer (for example your fans)
- Scripts : some shell scripts for settings some tweaks (yes, like in the playbooks, if ever you don't like ansible)
- Documentation : some MarkDown docs with everything you need to know about this repo, or softwares installed with them

# Warning

These playbooks are made for Desktop Computer with Arch Linux based Distribution and AMD Hardware, they're not tested on Laptops or Intel+Nvidia Hardware combo, use at your own risk !!!
