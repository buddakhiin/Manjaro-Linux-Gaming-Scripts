# How to Play on Linux

Yes you can play on Linux, it's not just an urban legend (SteamOS, Recalbox, Lakka, and Android wouldn't even exist if it wasn't the case)

But it doesn't work as on Windows, instead of downloading a .exe file, you'll have to search in your package manager (apt, yum, dnf, pacman) the softwares you'll need in order to play, and that's where this repository comes to the game.

You just need to install your softwares as if you're on your phone with your package manager(because yes, Android Play Store or Iphone AppStore are just packages managers), and then click on the icon, and that's where the magic works, it shows exactly like on your Window$ computer.

Steam and Itch it works exactly as is.

But for other launchers it's a little bit more complicated (but not too complicated)

- For Epic and GOG : you can use Heroic Game Launcher, a free launcher that lets you install and play EPIC and GOG games, and also sync your saves with your previous Epic and GOG Galaxy launcher you had on Windows or Mac (works only for Win and Mac games)
- For everything else : Lutris will help you, it's a free software which gives you a beautiful GUI for Wine which lets you install and play your Ubisoft, Blizzard, EA (add what you want else) games as if you were on Windows thanks to Wine, a software which lets you use .exe files on Linux
